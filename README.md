# 02-Pointer and array

- Write a program using C language.
  * Get 2 sets of 10 integer numbers sorted in ascending order each and print out the total 20 numbers sorted in descending order.

- Requirements
  * You should check whether the input numbers are sorted in ascending order and the number of integers is 2 * 10 in total. 
  * If not, you must print out the following error message and terminate your program, 
   "The input numbers are not in ascending order." Or, "You must input 2 sets of 10 numbers."
  * You must use pointer, array, and dynamic memory allocation.
  
- Execution example
  * [Input] 1, 2, 6, 8, 19, 100, 120, 210, 211, 212
             1, 3, 4, 9, 30, 50, 111, 211, 213, 215
    [Output] 215 213 212 211 210 120 111 100 50 30 19 9 8 6 4 3 2 1 -1
    
    [Input] 1, 2, 8, 6, 19, 100, 120, 210, 211, 212
    [Output] You should input 2 sets of 10 numbers
