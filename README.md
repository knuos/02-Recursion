# 02-Recursion

- Write a program using C language.
  * Define an array "two[]" that can store 10 items and store the power of two in the array
  * e.g., two[0] = 2^0, two[1] = 2^1
  * The program prints out the all items in the array, two[], using iteration (e.g., for)
  * A power of two can be calculated using "pow(a, b)" -> a^b in the header file, math.h 
  
- Execution example
  * [Output] two[0] = 1\n
             two[1] = 2\n
             two[2] = 4\n
             two[3] = 8 .....
